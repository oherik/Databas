All attributes are given by: 
S={courseCode, courseMaxStudents,courseCredit, classificationName, grade, courseName, departmentName, departmentAbbrevation, programmeName, programmeAbbreviation, studentID, studentName, studentCredit, branchName, dateRegistredOnWaiting}


The functional dependencies found: 
{courseCode} -> {courseMaxStudents, courseCredit, departmentName, departmentAbbrevation}
{departmentAbbrevation} -> {departmentName}
{departmentName} -> {departmentAbbrevation}
{programmeName} -> {programmeAbbreviation}
{studentID} -> {studentName, studentCredit, branchName, programmeName, programmeAbbreviation}
{studentID, courseCode} -> {dateRegisteredOnWaiting, grade}


Almost all of above are visible in our database schema, except the following: 
studentID -> programmeAbbreviation,
courseCode -> departmentName,
Since both of them are BCNF violations, they arenâ€™t inserted in our schema. This since {studentID} -> {programmeAbbreviation} can be written as the dependencies {studentID} -> {programmeName} && {programmeName} -> {programmeAbbreviation}. Likewise, {courseCode} -> {departmentName} can be given from {courseCode} -> {departmentAbbrevation} && {departmentAbbrevation} -> {departmentName}
